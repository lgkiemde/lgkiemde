# Hi, Iâ€™m Lisa Kiemde

## Who am I?
> I am a graduate student in MIS focusing in data analytics. I received a Bachelor's degree in 2016. My degree was in Secondary Math Eduation with a minor in German. I realized that teaching, although rewarding, would not allow me to help my family in the way I thought they deserved to be cared for. In choosing a new career, I focused on my love for math and my want to try to explain what numbers mean in certain contexts. I decided to focus on MIS and data analytics because I want a better life for my family and I want to work on intriging problems.
## Interests:
- ðŸ‘€ I am interested in data justice as well as mobile health. While I enjoy learning all subjects and seeing concepts from different prespectives, I especially like data justice and mobile health because it has the potential to help people.
