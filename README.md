- 👋 Hi, I’m Lisa Kiemde
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, math, data justice, healthcare, and being with my family. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding, MIS, GIS, and data analytics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects for class. I am in two classes that are currently using Github. So I'm hoping my repositories won't look too messy. 
- 📫 How to reach me... email me.
