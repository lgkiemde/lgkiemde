>Hi, I’m Lisa Kiemde
![Lisa Kiemde](image.jpg)

- I am a graduate student in MIS focusing in data analytics. I received a Bachelor's degree in 2016. My degree was in Secondary Math Eduation. I realized that teaching, although rewarding, would not allow me to help my family in the way I thought they deserved to be cared for. In choosing a new career, I focused on my love for math and my want to try to explain what numbers mean in certain contexts. I decided to focus on MIS and data analytics because I want a better life for my family and I want to work on intriging problems.
- 👀 I am interested in data justice as well as mobile health. While I enjoy learning all subjects and seeing concepts from different prespectives, I especially like data justice and mobile health because it has the potential to help people.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to go from data to decisions, using GIS for data visualization, and learning how to create web apps.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects for class. I am in two classes that are currently using Github. So I'm hoping my repositories won't look too messy. 
- 📫 The best way to reach me is either text me or email me.
